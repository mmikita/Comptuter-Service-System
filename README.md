Web Application written in Java in Spring MVC using embedded Database. 

To initialize 

 file contains database that is necessary for aplication to work. I used XAMPP/PHPMyadmin with standard configuration, but database source can be changed easily by modifying database.properties file which is stored in path 'ContactsOrganizerWebApp\src\main\resources\META-INF'.

To open initial page, for example after running application with Tomcat server, input path into browser: localhost:Tomcat_port_number/contacts
